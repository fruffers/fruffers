## Hullo there, I'm Louise. ðŸ™‚ðŸ™‚ðŸ™‚ðŸ™‚ðŸ¤–
- I am interested in robotics (mechanics, electronics, software), AI and intelligent or autonomous systems, embedded systems, video games programming, simulators, 2D art and animation, 3D modelling. I am interested to build robots and design digital worlds, clean plans, research, diagrams, peaceful music, and beautiful animations and art and comics.
- I'm currently working on a Rover simulation in Gazebo Fortress and on a real life platform, and a C++ chess game with SFML.
- I am learning more C++ and robotics.
