## Welcome to my coding den.
- I am interested in robotics and intelligent or autonomous systems, embedded systems, video games programming, simulators and digital twins, railway control systems, 2D art and animation, 3D modelling. I am interested to build robots and design digital worlds, plans, research, write documents, diagrams, music, and animations and art and comics. I also like trains and the railway!
- I am currently working on a rover simulation in Gazebo Fortress and on a real life platform, and learning more C++ and Cmake.
- I am learning more C++, robotics, C#, and 3D modelling, along with big software architecture and network interfaces/inter-process communication, and railway signalling software.
